# U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Costs---Portfolio-Project

This project uses a real-life dataset to develop a code with Python to address the goals outlined below.

Project Goals:

1. Determine whether there is a difference between average cost for men vs. women
    - Data: gender = qualitative; cost = quantitative
    - Analysis: 

    1. Determine the total number of  men and women. Is the dataset imbalanced?
    2. Calculate AVG medical costs grouped by gender. Is there a difference?

2. Analyse if there is a difference between medical costs in respect to region.
    - Data: cost = quantitative; region = qualitative
    - Analysis:

    1. Group the data from goal 1 by region. Is the gap greater in one region than the other?

3. How does having children impact the medical costs of women?
    - Data: no. children = qualitative; costs = qualitative
    - Analysis:

    1. Group AVG medical costs for women by number of children.
